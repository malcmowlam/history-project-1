  <li>A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,</li>
  <li>Accuse me thus, that i have scanted all,</li>
  <li>Against my love shall be as i am now</li>
  <li>Against that time (if ever that time come) </li>
<li>Ah wherefore with infection should he live, </li>
<li>Alack what poverty my muse brings forth, </li>
<li>Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there, </li>
<li>As a decrepit father takes delight, </li>
